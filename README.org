#+title: Readme

This year clojure again. Let's see, what has been forgotten in 2 years!

* What would I like to learn/improve this time?
- more debugging (e.g. cider, sayid, ghostwheel...)
- async/coroutines
- spec2 or malli
- test framework
- base project on deps.edn, not leiningen
- improve my cleverparens usage
